<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pheromone Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sex Pheromones</li><li>Aggregation Pheromones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural pheromones are classified into two main types: sex pheromones and aggregation pheromones. Sex pheromones are emitted by female insects to attract males for mating, while aggregation pheromones are released by a group of insects to attract more individuals to a feeding or breeding site. Both types of pheromones play a crucial role in pest management strategies in agriculture, as they can disrupt mating patterns and attract pests to traps for monitoring and control purposes.</p></p>
