<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Semi Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The market for disposable breathing circuits is classified into three types: open breathing circuits, semi-open breathing circuits, and closed breathing circuits. Open breathing circuits consist of a non-rebreathing valve, allowing the patient to inhale room air along with the oxygen supply. Semi-open breathing circuits mainly utilize a venturi mask for oxygen delivery. Closed breathing circuits involve a closed system where exhaled gases are trapped, filtered, and recycled back to the patient. Each type has its own advantages and is used in different medical scenarios based on patient requirements and desired outcomes.</p></p>
