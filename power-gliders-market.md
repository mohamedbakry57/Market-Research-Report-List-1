<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Gliders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Srtoke</li><li>4-Srtoke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Power gliders are classified into two market types based on the type of engine they use: 2-stroke and 4-stroke. In a 2-stroke power glider, the engine completes a power cycle in one rotation of the crankshaft, offering higher power output but emitting more pollutants. On the other hand, a 4-stroke power glider completes a power cycle in two rotations of the crankshaft, providing better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. These market types differentiate power gliders based on their engine technology and their respective advantages in terms of power and environmental impact.</p></p>
