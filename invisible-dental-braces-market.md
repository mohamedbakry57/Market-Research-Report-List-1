The integration of 3D printing technology has also allowed for the mass production of aligners, reducing manufacturing time and cost.</p><p>Another trend is the expansion of the target customer base. Initially, invisible braces were primarily used by young adults and teenagers. However, the market has seen increased adoption among adults as well. Manufacturers are now focusing on developing aligners that cater to the specific needs of adult patients, such as fixing orthodontic relapses or addressing other dental issues.</p><p>In conclusion, the invisible dental braces market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. Factors such as rising dental disorders, aesthetic concerns, and advancements in technology are driving market growth. The expansion of the target customer base, particularly adults, is also contributing to the increasing demand for invisible braces.</p></p>
