<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Base Isolation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NRB</li><li>LRB</li><li>HDR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seismic base isolation systems are designed to protect structures from earthquake vibrations. There are three types of such systems: NRB (Natural Rubber Bearings), LRB (Lead Rubber Bearings), and HDR (High Damping Rubber Bearings). NRB systems use layers of natural rubber to absorb and dissipate the energy, while LRB systems utilize lead-core bearings to provide both elasticity and damping. HDR systems utilize high-damping rubber to enhance energy dissipation. These systems are used in buildings, bridges, and other structures to minimize damage and ensure the safety of occupants during seismic events.</p></p>
