<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copper Pigtail Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Unshielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Copper Pigtail market can be classified into two types: Shielded and Unshielded. Shielded pigtail cables are designed with an additional layer of protection, usually made of metallic foil or braid, to mitigate electromagnetic interference. They are suitable for environments prone to high levels of electrical noise and offer better signal integrity. On the other hand, unshielded pigtail cables lack this additional shielding layer and are therefore more economical. They are commonly used in situations where electromagnetic interference is not a major concern.</p></p>
