<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The NICU ventilator market consists of two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are used for babies who require a more aggressive form of respiratory support, where a tube is inserted into the baby's airway to deliver oxygen and help with breathing. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver oxygen and support breathing without the need for intubation. These can be used for babies with less severe respiratory issues or as a first line of treatment before resorting to invasive ventilation.</p></p>
