<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Yellow Pea Protein Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pea Protein Concentrates</li><li>Pea Protein Isolates</li><li>Textured Pea Protein</li><li>Hydrolyzed Pea Protein</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Yellow Pea Protein market can be classified into four types: Pea Protein Concentrates, Pea Protein Isolates, Textured Pea Protein, and Hydrolyzed Pea Protein. Pea Protein Concentrates are made by removing the starch and fiber from yellow peas, preserving a high amount of protein. Pea Protein Isolates undergo further processing to remove more carbohydrates, resulting in a purer protein content. Textured Pea Protein is created by extruding and shaping pea protein into a meat-like texture. Hydrolyzed Pea Protein is enzymatically treated to break down the protein into smaller peptides for easier digestion and absorption.</p></p>
