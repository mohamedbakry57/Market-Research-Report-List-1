<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Harvester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cancellous Bone Harvesting</li><li>Marrow Harvesting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone Harvester is a medical device used in orthopedic and spinal surgeries to retrieve cancellous bone and marrow. Cancellous Bone Harvesting involves removing cancellous (spongy) bone, often from the pelvis, which is rich in regenerative cells and used to fill bone defects. Marrow Harvesting, on the other hand, involves extracting marrow from the bone, which contains stem cells used to treat conditions like blood disorders and cancer. Both types of bone harvesting contribute to the development of innovative treatments and advancements in regenerative medicine.</p></p>
