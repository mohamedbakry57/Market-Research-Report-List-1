<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The District Heating Pipe Network Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Water Heating Network</li><li>Steam Heating Network</li></ul></p>
<p><p>District Heating Pipe Network Market Types:</p><p>1. Hot Water Heating Network: This market type involves the use of a centralized heating system where hot water is distributed through a network of pipes to supply heat to multiple buildings or homes. The hot water is generated from a central energy source, such as a heat pump or a power plant, and is circulated through insulated pipes to transfer heat energy for space heating and domestic hot water purposes.</p><p>2. Steam Heating Network: In this market type, a central steam generation facility produces steam that is distributed through a network of pipes to provide heat to various buildings or homes. The steam carries thermal energy and is employed for space heating purposes. It is generated by boiling water using a heat source, and the resulting steam is conveyed through well-insulated pipes to deliver heat to the end-users, where it condenses, releasing its latent heat before being returned to the central facility for regeneration.</p></p>
