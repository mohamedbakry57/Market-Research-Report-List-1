<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive CFRP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive CFRP market is segmented into two main types: thermosetting and thermoplastic. Thermosetting CFRP materials are characterized by a chemical reaction during the curing process, which irreversibly solidifies the material. This results in a strong and rigid composite that is ideal for structural applications in vehicles. In contrast, thermoplastic CFRP materials can be melted and reshaped multiple times, offering greater flexibility and ease of processing. These materials are typically used in non-structural components such as interior trim and aesthetic panels in automotive applications.</p></p>
