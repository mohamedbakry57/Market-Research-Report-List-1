<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sunblock Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Sunblock</li><li>Chemical Sunblock</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sunblock, also known as sunscreen, is divided into two main market types: physical sunblock and chemical sunblock. Physical sunblock works by physically blocking and scattering the sun's rays away from the skin. It contains mineral-based ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. On the other hand, chemical sunblock absorbs the sun's UV rays and converts them into heat, preventing them from damaging the skin. Chemical sunblock utilizes various chemicals such as avobenzone or oxybenzone. Both types aim to protect the skin from harmful UV radiation, but they work through different mechanisms.</p></p>
