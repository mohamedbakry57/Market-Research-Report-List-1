<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tension Rod Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Adjustable Type</li><li>Adjustable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive tension rods are classified into two main types: non-adjustable type and adjustable type. Non-adjustable tension rods are fixed in length and provide stability by reducing chassis flex during cornering and braking. On the other hand, adjustable tension rods allow for customization of the rod's length, enabling users to fine-tune their vehicle's handling characteristics. Both types of tension rods serve the purpose of improving overall suspension performance and promoting better handling and stability.</p></p>
