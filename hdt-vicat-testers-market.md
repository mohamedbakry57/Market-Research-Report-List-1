<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDT & Vicat Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDT (Heat Deflection Temperature) and Vicat testers are used in the testing of polymers to determine their temperature resistance and softening point. In the market, there are two types of testers available: semi-automatic and automatic. Semi-automatic testers require manual loading of the specimen and application of force, while the measurement is automated. Automatic testers, on the other hand, automate the entire testing process, including specimen loading and force application. Both types offer different levels of automation, allowing users to choose the testing method that best suits their needs and preferences.</p></p>
