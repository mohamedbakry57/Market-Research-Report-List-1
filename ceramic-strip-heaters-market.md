<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Strip Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiant Ceramic Strip Heaters (PCTR)</li><li>Rigid Ceramic Strip Heaters (PCR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic strip heaters are categorized into two main types: radiant ceramic strip heaters (PCTR) and rigid ceramic strip heaters (PCR). Radiant ceramic strip heaters utilize a ceramic element coated with an infrared emitter to produce radiant heat. These heaters are lightweight, flexible, and ideal for applications that require precise temperature control. On the other hand, rigid ceramic strip heaters are made with a sturdier ceramic element and offer higher watt densities. They are commonly used for processes that demand higher temperatures or harsh environments.</p></p>
