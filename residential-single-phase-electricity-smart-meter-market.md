<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Single Phase Electricity Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The residential single-phase electricity smart meter market can be divided into two types: IC card and non-IC card. IC card meters use integrated circuit technology to store and manage electricity consumption information. These meters require users to purchase and insert a specific IC card for electricity payment and consumption monitoring. On the other hand, non-IC card meters do not require a separate card for electricity management. Instead, they utilize built-in technology to directly measure and record electricity consumption data.</p></p>
