<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone-anchored Hearing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bone-anchored hearing system market includes two types: implantable and non-implantable systems. Implantable systems involve a surgical procedure where a device, such as a titanium implant, is directly placed into the skull bone to transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear. Non-implantable systems, on the other hand, do not require surgery and can be worn externally. These systems use a sound processor that transmits sound vibrations through the skin and bone to the inner ear. Both types aim to provide improved hearing for individuals with hearing loss.</p></p>
