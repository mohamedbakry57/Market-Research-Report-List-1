<p><strong>The Track Geometry Measurement System(TGMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Contact Based Track Geometry Measurement System(TGMS)</li><li>Contact Based Track Geometry Measurement System(TGMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS) is used to monitor the condition of railway tracks. There are two types of TGMS markets: No Contact-Based and Contact-Based. No Contact-Based TGMS utilizes laser or image-based technology to measure track geometry parameters without physical contact with the track. This system is quick, accurate, and eliminates the risk of damage to the track. On the other hand, Contact-Based TGMS uses sensors or measurement devices that physically touch the track to collect data. This system provides precise measurements but carries the risk of track damage.</p></p>
