<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Semi Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breathing circuits are used in medical procedures to deliver oxygen and anesthesia to patients. Open breathing circuits allow both inhalation and exhalation to occur in ambient air, while semi-open breathing circuits recirculate a portion of exhaled gases. Closed breathing circuits, on the other hand, do not release any gases into the environment and are used for patients with highly contagious diseases. These different types of circuits provide varying levels of infection control, safety, and efficiency depending on the specific medical requirement and patient condition.</p></p>
