<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIGIT Therapies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monotherapy</li><li>Combination Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIGIT therapies refer to treatments that target the T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs. There are two main types of TIGIT therapies: monotherapy and combination therapy. Monotherapy involves using TIGIT inhibitors alone to target the TIGIT pathway and enhance immune response. Combination therapy, on the other hand, combines TIGIT inhibitors with other immunotherapies or targeted therapies to maximize their efficacy. Both approaches aim to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy cancerous cells, offering potential treatment options for various types of cancer.</p></p>
