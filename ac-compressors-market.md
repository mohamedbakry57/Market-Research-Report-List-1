<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Compressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC compressors are used in air conditioning systems to compress refrigerant gas, allowing it to absorb heat from the indoor environment and release it outside. There are two main types of AC compressors: positive displacement and centrifugal compressors. </p><p>Positive displacement compressors work by trapping and compressing gas within a chamber, using mechanisms such as pistons or scrolls. They are suitable for small to medium-sized systems and offer high efficiency at lower flow rates.</p><p>Centrifugal compressors, on the other hand, use a rotating impeller to accelerate gas, increasing its velocity and subsequently its pressure. These compressors are more commonly used in larger systems requiring high flow rates and are known for their ability to handle large volumes of gas efficiently.</p></p>
