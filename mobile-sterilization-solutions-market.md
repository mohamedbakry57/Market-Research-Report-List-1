<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Sterilization Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the mobile sterilization solutions market, there are two main types: closed loop and open loop. The closed loop market refers to a system where the sterilization process occurs within a self-contained unit, without any external release of the sterilizing agent. This ensures maximum safety and containment. On the other hand, the open loop market involves a system where sterilization is performed externally, with the sterilizing agent being released into the environment. While this method may be more convenient, there is a higher risk of exposure to the sterilizing agent.</p></p>
