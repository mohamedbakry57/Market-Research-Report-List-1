<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Start Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Start Cart</li><li>Air Start Truck</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air Start Units are essential equipment used in aviation to supply compressed air to start aircraft engines. There are two main types of Air Start Units: Air Start Carts and Air Start Trucks. Air Start Carts are mobile units that provide compressed air directly to the aircraft, offering flexibility and maneuverability. On the other hand, Air Start Trucks are larger vehicles with built-in air compressors, allowing them to supply compressed air to multiple aircraft simultaneously. Both types serve the same purpose of initiating engine ignition but differ in terms of their mobility and capacity.</p></p>
